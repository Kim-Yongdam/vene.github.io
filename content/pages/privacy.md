# Privacy Policy

This is just a humble personal website.  It is completely static and hosted by
<a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.  For my convenience in operating it, I use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>.  I personally only occasionally look at the user statistics they provide to figure
out why my website gets attention. I do not distribute or share this information with anybody.  By visiting my website, some of your information can be logged by the service providers listed above.  I encourage you to disable cookies and surf as anonymously as possible when visiting my website.

At some point I will switch to a more privacy-sensitive analytics platform.
