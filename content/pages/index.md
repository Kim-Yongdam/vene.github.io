Hi! I'm Vlad, and I'm CS PhD candidate
at [Cornell](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/), advised by [Claire
Cardie](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/).
I work on machine learning & natural language processing,
focusing on structure and sparsity.
I am a [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) "alum" and
I develop the [polylearn](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/polylearn)
library for factorization machines and polynomial networks in Python.
