# Allow me to introduce myself
Welcome, traveller, to my page. Enjoy your brief stay while you get to
know me!

My name is Vlad and I'm a  PhD student
at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](http://mpi-sws.org) in
Saarbr√ºcken, advised by [Cristian
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil](http://mpi-sws.org/~cristian/).
I am also a
scientific Python developer, sometimes contributing to the
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) machine learning library.
I am collaborating with the [Center for Computational Linguistics at
the University of Bucharest](http://nlp.unibuc.ro/).

# What's on this site?

You can take a look at the list of my [publications](papers.html).   The
materials for [talks](talks.html) that I've had the honour of giving are also
available.

If you can spare a minute, please go over to my [blog](blog/index.html).

If you're (or were) in one of my classes, you can find links and stuff I
collected for you in the [teaching](teaching.html) section.

You can read about the [fonts](fonts.html) I'm using on this page and I'm sure
you'll find it interesting, especially if you're mathematically inclined. Then
again, people don't usually get my math jokes, so I won't get my hopes up.
