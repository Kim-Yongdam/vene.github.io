<img style="float: right" src="vlad-niculae.jpg" alt="Vlad Niculae" />

Welcome, traveler, to my page. Enjoy your brief stay while you get to
know me!
My name is Vlad and I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science
at [Cornell](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/), advised by [Claire
Cardie](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/).

I am also a scientific Python developer, maintainter of the
[polylearn](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/polylearn) library
for factorization machines and polynomial networks in Python,
and sometimes contributing to the
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) machine learning library.
I am collaborating with the [Center for Computational Linguistics at
the University of Bucharest](http://nlp.unibuc.ro/).

# Research

You can take a look at the list of my [publications](papers.html). The
materials for [talks](talks.html) that I've had the honor of giving are also
available.

# Miscellanea

Whenever I code something that I think is cool and could be useful,
I [blog](blog/index.html) about it.

You can read about the [fonts](fonts.html) I'm using on this page and I'm sure
you'll find it interesting, especially if you're mathematically inclined. Then
again, people don't usually get my math jokes, so I won't get my hopes up.
