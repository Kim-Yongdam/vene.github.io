# Allow me to introduce myself
Welcome, traveller, to my page. Enjoy your brief stay while you get to
know me!

**Update** Wenn Sie mein Personalausweis gefunden haben, bitte melden Sie
(vlad<span style="display:none">...</span>@vene.ro).  Sie bekommen von mir eine
Belohnung.

My name is Vlad, I'm a scientific Python developer and a student researcher
in natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics.  At the moment I am honoured to be a 6 month
research fellow in the [Max Planck Institute for Software
Systems](http://mpi-sws.org) in Saarbr√ºcken, advised by [Cristian
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil](http://mpi-sws.org/~cristian/).  I am collaborating
frequently with the [Centre for Computational Linguistics at the University of
Bucharest](http://nlp.unibuc.ro/). You might know me from twitter as
[@vnfrombucharest](https://www.twitter.com/vnfrombucharest) or from github as
[@vene](https://www.github.com/vene). I'm also on
[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/vlad.niculae) and
[g+](http://gplus.to/vladn). I am a contributor to the
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) machine learning library for the
scientific Python ecosystem. You can transmit your thoughts to me at vlad<span

Elegant code that runs fast. **Reproducible research**. **Open data**.

# What's on this site?

You should take a look at the list of my [publications](papers.html). It's not
much, but I try. The materials for [talks](talks.html) that I've had the honour
of giving are also available.

If you can spare a minute, please go over to my [blog](blog/index.html).

If you're (or were) in one of my classes, you can find links and stuff I
collected for you in the [teaching](teaching.html) section.

You can read about the [fonts](fonts.html) I'm using on this page and I'm sure
you'll find it interesting, especially if you're mathematically inclined. Then
again, people don't usually get my math jokes, so I won't get my hopes up.
