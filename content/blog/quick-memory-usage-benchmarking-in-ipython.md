Everybody loves `%timeit`, there's no doubt about it. So why not have
something like that, but for measuring how much memory your line takes?
Well, now you can; grab a hold of the script in the following gist and
run it like in the example.

[gist id=3022718]

Instead of taking care of the dirty process inspection stuff myself, I
decided to delegate this to Fabian's simple but very good
[`memory_profiler`][]. There is also [Guppy][] available, but its design
seems a bit and overkill for this task.

Please contact me if you find problems with this implementation, this is
a preliminary, quick hack-y version. :)
