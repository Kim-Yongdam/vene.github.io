The [scikit-learn-speed project][] now has memory usage benchmarking!

This was accomplished by building on what I described in my recent
posts, specifically the extensions to Fabian's [memory\_profiler][] that
you can find in [my fork][], but they will be merged upstream soon. The
key element is the `%magic_memit` function whose development I blogged
about [on][] [several][] [occasions][]. I plugged this into [vbench][]
in a similar way to how the timings are computed, all with great
success.

Here is a screenshot of the way a simple benchmark looks now, with just
a few data points.

You can check it out and use it yourself for your benchmarks, but you
need to use the vbench from the [memory branch on my fork][].

Of course, there are some important caveats. I am running this on my
laptop, which runs OS X Lion, so, under the effect of [this
bug][occasions], I hardcoded the '`-i`' so the memory benchmarks are not
realistic. Also, the y-range should probably be forced wider, because
the plots look erratic, showing the very small noise at a large-scale.
