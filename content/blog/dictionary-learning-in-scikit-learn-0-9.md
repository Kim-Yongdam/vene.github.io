Thanks to Olivier, GaÃ«l and Alex, who reviewed the code heavily the last
couple of days, and with apologies for my lack of activity during a
sequence of conferences, Dictionary learning has officially been merged
into scikit-learn master, and just in time for the new scikit-learn 0.9
release. Here are some glimpses of the examples you can run for
yourself:

The stars of this new release are: the manifold learning module by Jake
Vanderplas and Fabian Pedregosa, the Dirichlet process gaussian mixture
model by Alexandre Passos, and many others, as you can see from the
[development changelog][] (as soon as the release is made, I will update
this post with permanent links).

The release is due tomorrow. I will also be in charge with building the
Windows installers for this release, let's hope I do a good job and you
can think of me and smile when installing!
