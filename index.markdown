# Allow me to introduce myself
Welcome, traveller, to my page. Enjoy your brief stay while you get to
know me!

My name is Vlad, I'm a scientific Python developer and a student researcher
in computational linguistics at the University of Bucharest. You might know me
from twitter as [@vnfrombucharest](https://www.twitter.com/vnfrombucharest) or
from github as [@vene](https://www.github.com/vene). I'm also on 
[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/vlad.niculae) and
[Google Plus](http://gplus.to/vladn). I am a contributor to the
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) machine learning library for the
scientific Python ecosystem. You can transmit your thoughts to me at

# Topics I want to work on in the near future

Cognate extraction, corpus pattern analysis, web n-gram corpus building,
gazeteer building. On the more applied side I have a cool project in mind
regarding extracting data from rendered plots. Please contact me if you are
interested in working together 

# What's on this site?

You should take a look at the list of my [publications](papers.html). It's not
much, but I try. For now I only have conference posters. The materials for
[talks](talks.html) that I've had the honour of giving are also available.

If you can spare a minute, please go over to my [blog](http://blog.vene.ro/)
even if it doesn't look as nice as this page for the moment. I try to keep it
interesting though.

If you're in one of my classes, you can find links and stuff I collected for
you in the [teaching](teaching.html) section.

You can read about the [fonts](fonts.html) I'm using on this page and I'm sure
you'll find it interesting, especially if you're mathematically inclined. Then
again, people don't usually get my math jokes, so I won't get my hopes up.
